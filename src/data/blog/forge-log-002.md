We staged an adversarial exercise against a production LLM endpoint to shake loose blind spots before launch. The drill surfaced three big lessons:

1. **Telemetry matters more than policies.** Without high-resolution traces, we would have missed the chained prompt injection wrapped in normal user behavior.
2. **Automated containment must be reversible.** We tuned the guardrails to lock down suspect threads, but built a manual override so the on-call engineer can restore service after inspection.
3. **Incident comms need templates.** Drafting stakeholder updates on the fly created drift. We now keep pre-approved briefs in the runbook.

Next steps: expand the test harness with fuzzed tool arguments and push remediation hooks into the CI pipeline so every new agent skill comes with an abuse response checklist.
