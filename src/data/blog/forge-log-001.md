The retrieval layer is only as trustworthy as its normalization and monitoring. This log captures the first sprint of hardening the pipeline for a client deployment that needed to ingest more than a million vectors without losing latency guarantees.

Key moves:

- Replaced naive upserts with bulk import windows and deterministic ID hashing.
- Added dual telemetry: structured traces for ingestion and ad-hoc attack surface probes.
- Stress-tested failure domains by replaying poison-pill documents and prompt flooding.

Next iteration will focus on adaptive throttling at the edge and a short write-up on tuning retrieval scoring when embeddings go stale.
